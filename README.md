# Academic Pedagogy & Technical Resources

This repository contains pedagogical materials and academic documentation developed for undergraduate students in Mathematics and Computer Science. The content primarily supports my work as a mentor and instructor within the Google Developer Groups (GDG) on Campus framework.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Undergraduate Curriculum (`/undergraduate-curriculum`)
Comprehensive revision sheets and exercise sets focusing on fundamental Mathematics and Computer Science.
* **Lecture Summaries:** Summarized theory for Analysis, Algebra, and Discrete Mathematics.
* **Exercise Sets:** Selected problems with detailed solutions emphasizing proof techniques.

### 2. Examination Frameworks (`/examination-frameworks`)
Materials designed for student assessment and the preparation of oral examinations.
* **Oral Exam Prompts:** Technical questions used to evaluate logical reasoning and theoretical depth.
* **Evaluation Methodology:** Guidelines on academic rigor, clarity of speech, and mathematical demonstration standards.

### 3. Guided Technical Projects (`/guided-technical-projects`)
Project-based learning resources designed to bridge the gap between classroom theory and practical implementation.
* **Modeling Case Studies:** Briefs for projects involving differential equations and numerical simulations.
* **Implementation Guides:** Documentation for developing algorithmic solutions with a focus on code efficiency and structure.
